# Python is slow while running, but fast in development phase


# interpreter vs compiler
# fast  || slow
# debugging easy || debugging hard
# one by one || whole at a time

# Intro to python 
# 1. High level lang
# 2. Dynamic 
# 3. Interpreted
# 4. It supports purely object oriented programming as well as procedural programming (functions)

# Why python 
# 1. easy to code
# 2. easy to read
# 3. High - level language
# 4. Object - oriented language
# 5. GUI programming support
# 6. Large community support
# 7. easy to debug
# 8. Allocate memory dynamically

# History of python
# 1. Made by Guido Van rossum
# Named after a show of 80's Montie python circus
# Released officially in 1991
# 2001 released python version 2
# 2008 - python version 3, industry standard
# Right now python version 3.14 is with us

# Features of Python 
# 1. Open source programming language
# 2. Platform independent        -- can run on any operating system (condition - python should be installed)
# 3. Large standard library
# 4. Extensible and embeddeble

# Python is strongly typed


# Different libraries used in Different domains
# WebDev - django, flask
# ML and AI - NumPy, Keras, SciPy, SeaBorn
# Data Science - TensorFlow, Pandas
# Game development - Pygame
# Web scrapping - beautiful soup, Pandas, matplotlib

# Key benifits of using python for web - dev
# 1. purely object oriented, fast development
# 2. open source

# Python framework
# 1. django, flask  -----> mainly used
# 2. cherryPy
